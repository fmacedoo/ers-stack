## ERS stack

A basic application made with Electron, React, and SQLite tech stack as a part of the post [Standalone application with Electron, React, and SQLite stack.](https://fmacedoo.medium.com/standalone-application-with-electron-react-and-sqlite-stack-9536a8b5a7b9) on Medium.

### Run

> yarn electron-dev

Runs the app in the development mode. A brand new window will be opened by electron automatically.

### Improvements

As I have been seeing a good number of forks here, and likes on Medium. I invite you all to suggest improvements creating Issues or even offering some hands opening new PR's for what you all would like to see merged on it.
